# Hopkins-Course-Evaluations-Chrome-Extension

Chrome Extension that makes AJAX requests to an API that I previously created that serves JSON data from Johns Hopkins course evaluation surveys including course ratings and student comments. 
This extension takes evaluation data obtained from the API and integrates it directly onto Johns Hopkins course search via inserted text and pop-up bubbles.


The code for the API mentioned above can be found here: https://github.com/TahaBaig1/HopkinsCourseEvaluationsAPI
